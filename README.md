## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Screenshot

This was my result (Mobile Desing)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Desing

### What I learned

I learned how to import Google Fonts directly into the CSS file. It was also a great opportunity to practice HTML, CSS, OOCSS and BEM and use CSS variables.

BEM code I liked:

```html
<section class="card card--small">
```
```css
.card--small {
    max-width: 18rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I will improve my knowledge in HTML, CSS, OOCSS and BEM. In future projects, I'd like to practice the mobile-first concept more and use media queries, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements in CSS.

## Acknowledgments

I looked at many projects, to see how others respond to this challenge, I want to highlight one project that helped me to support my solution proposal in terms of HTML and CSS code, especially in the use of BEM (Block, Element, and Modifier).

### Useful project

- Frontend Mentor - [@MelvinAguilar](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/MelvinAguilar) - [QR code component solution](https://github.com/MelvinAguilar/qr-code-component) - This helped me for the BEM structure. I really liked this pattern.

**Note: I didn't replicate this solution, I just wanted to make sure my understanding of BEM was clear, because I learned it recently and this was my first time using it.**
